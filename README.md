## About
I am a college student based in Pheonix, Arizona that has a passion for technology and the outdoors. I've been developing and securing systems for close to five years and love to work on projects that test my skills and efficiency. I am currently working on developing [@firesideservers](https://github.com/firesideservers) in my free time.
