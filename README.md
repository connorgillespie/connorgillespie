## About
I am a high school student based in Southern California that has a passion for technology and the outdoors. I've been developing and securing systems for close to four years and love to work on projects that test my skills and efficiency. I am currently working on developing [@virtualnetwork-us](https://github.com/virtualnetwork-us) in my free time.
